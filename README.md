How we set the Resend Library:

Resend Api is an api that focuses to send transactional email and not getting to our spam gmail folders.

Eventhough the demo part is easy to start with but integration of resend on Production with a domain names does require a couple of steps

- Go to [namecheap](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/) create account and buy a domain name there
- Go to Advance DNS in [namecheap] to add host records from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the [resend](https://resend.com/) itself
- Add `a record` generated by [vercel] to the [host-record] under Advance DNS to sync the network between vercel platform and Namecheap
- Add both `TXT records` generated from [resend](https://resend.com/) to the [host-record]
- then last add the `MX records` from resend to [mail-settings]
- To fullfill the networking between vercel and resend add three of `TXT records` and `MX records` with vercel.
- save by click the tick mark and in [resend] press the [verify-DNS]

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
